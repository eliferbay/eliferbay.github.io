[All the Missing Ladies: Political Selection in High-stakes Contests](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4946659), (with Selcen Çakır & Konstantinos Matakos), *forthcoming in* **Electoral Studies**

<p align="justify">
How do parties update candidate lists after electoral setbacks, and what does this mean for women’s representation? We exploit Turkey’s 2015 back-to-back parliamentary elections as quasi-experimental leverage and implement a difference-in-differences design that compares the governing Justice and Development Party (JDP) to the Republican People’s Party (RPP), whose March 2015 primaries largely fixed the district‑level gender composition of slates. Falling short of a single-party majority in June was followed by a roughly 40% contraction in the JDP’s women candidates and a disproportionate downgrading at electable ranks, interrupting a decade-long upward trend. The contraction is concentrated in conservative strongholds. A rank-weighted decomposition shows that net removals, rather than simple demotions, account for most of the decline; changes outside electable ranks are smaller and imprecisely estimated. Event-time estimates indicate the shock produced a one-off adjustment that reverted by 2018. Taken together, the evidence is most consistent with a mix of statistical discrimination where seats are at stake and attribution bias that overshoots, illustrating how elite responses under compressed timelines can quickly erode representational gains in closed-list systems. </p>

[The Effect of Gender Norms on Intergenerational Mobility in Türkiye](https://eliferbay.github.io/assets/pdf/GTU_mobility.pdf)

<p align="justify">
This paper investigates whether and to what extent local gender norms causally shape intergenerational educational mobility of women in Türkiye. I combine three waves of Turkish Demographic and Health Surveys (TDHS) between 2008-2018 with retrospective migration histories and construct a region x year indicator of gender norms for the period 1993-2018. The analysis focuses on daughters aged 21-49 whose mothers attained at most primary school and who migrated internally between ages 12-29. Intergenerational mobility is measured using mother-daughter educational attainment. The empirical strategy compares mobility outcomes of daughters who move across regions at different ages, and exploits variation in exposure to local gender norms generated by differences in age at move. The results show that moving to a more gender-egalitarian region at key schooling margins increases bottom-to-up mobility linearly in exposure time, whereas a placebo outcome - bottom persistence - exhibits no meaningful effect. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that these gains are driven by moves into more egalitarian destinations, while moves into more patriarchal regions do not generate symmetric losses, consistent with the idea that earlier exposure to egalitarian norms is difficult to undo. Additional evidence shows that daughters who move to destinations with smaller gender-norm gaps between origin and destination - i.e., lower cultural distance - experience larger increases in upward mobility, in line with an adaptation mechanism. </p>
