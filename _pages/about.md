Welcome to my web-site!

I'm a research fellow in Economics at Istanbul University. In fall 2025, I will be a Visiting PhD Fellow at the World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER) in Helsinki, Finland.

My research lies at the intersection of education, migration, gender, and inequality, with a particular focus on how opportunities are transmitted across generations. My dissertation analyzes intergenerational educational mobility and inequality dynamics in Türkiye, with an emphasis on the mechanisms that sustain or reduce persistence across generations.

You can find more details on my published and ongoing work in the [Research](https://eliferbay.github.io/publications/)  section.

For an overview of my academic background, teaching, and professional activities, please see my [CV](https://eliferbay.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_academic.pdf).
