The reform extended the compulsory education duration from 5 years to 8 years. The policy had an impact on individuals born in 1987 onwards, whereas those born in earlier years were unaffected. This allows us to employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and reveal the causal impact of the reform on women’s educational outcomes, their status in the family, and their perceptions and attitudes towards gender roles in relation to the Fifth Sustainable Development Goal. We examined the 2008, 2013, and 2018 waves of the Turkish Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS), which is a nationally representative micro dataset. Results show that this large-scale reform has led to significant improvements in women’s educational outcomes. The policy has led to increases in the years of education, and completion of grade 8 and grade 11 for women, as well as a decrease in educational disparities between spouses. However, when we check other empowerment-related outcomes within the family, results show that the extent of empowerment is quite limited. Only one outcome in each set of variables (perception of gender roles, perception of physical violence, financial independence) shows empowerment. This suggests that higher educational attainment and improved educational status compared to the husband are not reflected in daily lives and the perceptions of women. All in all, stronger educational outcomes for women resulting from the policy have minor empowering effects.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/migrationeduc2023-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/migrationeduc2023-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/migrationeduc2023-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="300px" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/migrationeduc2023.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="migrationeduc2023.png" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="jhcmigration23" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Syrian Refugees and Human Capital Accumulation of Working-age Native Children in Turkey</div> <div class="author"> Selcen Çakır, Elif Erbay, and Murat Kırdar </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Human Capital</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/726628" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The arrival of Syrian refugees has significantly changed the labor-market conditions and the relative abundance of different skill groups in Turkey. We examine how the arrival of Syrian refugees affects school enrollment and employment of working-age native children using a difference-in-differences instrumental variable methodology. We find a significant drop in employment, largely due to children shifting from work-school balance to education only. School enrollment rises for boys, especially those with educated parents. However, the rate of girls not engaged in employment or education increases, particularly among those with less-educated parents, but decreases for boys with more-educated parents.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="covideduc" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Effect of Covid-19 on Primary School Enrollments: Evidence from Turkey</div> <div class="author"> Elif Erbay </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Post Covid Era: Future of Economies and World Order, IU Press</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://cdn.istanbul.edu.tr/file/JTA6CLJ8T5/975913870B044D75B60AFC244663DE10" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic caused considerable changes in every division in life, including online learning integrated into the formal education system. Since it had been a new experience for students and teachers, most parents had expressed their concerns over the effectiveness of the learning process. Hence, both the direct impacts of the pandemic and policies adopted in this period have substantially changed educational outcomes. This study empirically analyzes how Covid-19 affected primary school enrollments in Turkey using administrative data. Estimated findings show that primary school enrollments decreased by 1.8% in the 2020/2021 academic year. The primary source of this decline is that 5-year-old children who would have gone to public schools in the absence of the pandemic did not attend school during the pandemic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <hr> <div class="header-bar"> <h2> WORKING PAPERS </h2> </div> <p><strong>All the Missing Ladies: Political Selection in High-stakes Contests,</strong> (<em>with S. Çakır &amp; K. Matakos</em>)</p> <p>Abstract: How does political selection respond when the electoral stakes increase? Who gets to represent us? We study the effect that changes in the intensity of electoral competition has on women’s political representation in Turkey. We leverage occurrence of two consecutive legislative elections within few months as a natural experiment giving rise to a DiD strategy which allows us to identify JDP’s changes in its list composition and rank as a response to heightened competition. We find that the latter led to a wholesale removal and demotion of women candidates from its lists, bucking the previous trend of increasing female representation. Heterogeneity analysis further reveals that most of the women candidates were removed from electable seats and safe (conservative) districts. While this is consistent with theories of statistical discrimination, the removal of women even from inconsequential positions also reveals taste-based discrimination that has a compounding effect. A counterfactual exercise shows that had lists remained unchanged between the two elections, JDP’s female representation in parliament would have been up by 50%, thus highlighting the role that intra-party politics play in exacerbating gender-based discrimination own-gender bias in political selection.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Prolonged Guesthood: The Effects of Syrian Refugees on Voting Behavior in Turkey,</strong> (<em>with E.K. Usta</em>)</p> <p>Abstract: Following the onset of the Syrian humanitarian crisis, millions of Syrians sought refuge in Turkey with the hope of returning home when the conflict subsides. A decade later, 3.2 million Syrians live in Turkey under temporary protection status and their prolonged presence initiated a nationalist and anti-refugee sentiment. This study investigates the effect of Syrian refugee inflow on the voting behavior of natives focusing on parliamentary elections between 2002-2023 in Turkey. We utilize administrative data at the provincial level, employ a difference-in-differences strategy for the identification and distance-based instrumental variable to account for the endogenous refugee settlement. We find a positive and significant effect of refugees on the far-right nationalistic party’s (MHP) vote share, while there are no effects on the vote share of the incumbent party (AKP) and the main opposition party (CHP). Although MHP’s stance is not explicitly anti-refugee and has an alliance with incumbent AKP (announced the open-door policy), the increased support for the far-right party can be explained through the perceived threat that natives experienced especially after 2015 due to increased polarization and extraordinary times that the country went through (attempted coup; change of government system; Covid-19 pandemic; worsening economic conditions). In the context of a non-Western developing country, these findings resonate with the globalization-related shocks and the surge of populism and anti-refugee parties in the West.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Elif Erbay .
