  title={Syrian Refugees and Human Capital Accumulation of Working-age Native Children in Turkey},
  author={Çakır, Selcen and Erbay, Elif and Kırdar, Murat},
  abstract={The arrival of Syrian refugees has significantly changed the labor-market conditions and the relative abundance of different skill groups in Turkey. We examine how the arrival of Syrian refugees affects school enrollment and employment of working-age native children using a difference-in-differences instrumental variable methodology. We find a significant drop in employment, largely due to children shifting from work-school balance to education only. School enrollment rises for boys, especially those with educated parents. However, the rate of girls not engaged in employment or education increases, particularly among those with less-educated parents, but decreases for boys with more-educated parents.},

  title={The Effect of Covid-19 on Primary School Enrollments: Evidence from Turkey},
  author={Erbay, Elif},
  abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic caused considerable changes in every division in life, including online learning integrated into the formal education system. Since it had been a new experience for students and teachers, most parents had expressed their concerns over the effectiveness of the learning process. Hence, both the direct impacts of the pandemic and policies adopted in this period have substantially changed educational outcomes. This study empirically analyzes how Covid-19 affected primary school enrollments in Turkey using administrative data. Estimated findings show that primary school enrollments decreased by 1.8% in the 2020/2021 academic year. The primary source of this decline is that 5-year-old children who would have gone to public schools in the absence of the pandemic did not attend school during the pandemic.},

  title={Women Empowerment through Compulsory Schooling Reform: The Case of Türkiye},
  author={Usta, E.Kübra and Erbay, Elif},
  abstract={This study investigates the causal impacts of the 1997 compulsory schooling reform on women’s empowerment
in Türkiye. The reform extended the compulsory education duration from 5 years to 8 years. The policy had an
impact on individuals born in 1987 onwards, whereas those born in earlier years were unaffected. This allows us to
employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and reveal the causal impact of the reform on women’s educational
outcomes, their status in the family, and their perceptions and attitudes towards gender roles in relation to the Fifth
Sustainable Development Goal. We examined the 2008, 2013, and 2018 waves of the Turkish Demographic and
Health Survey (TDHS), which is a nationally representative micro dataset. Results show that this large-scale reform
has led to significant improvements in women’s educational outcomes. The policy has led to increases in the years
of education, and completion of grade 8 and grade 11 for women, as well as a decrease in educational disparities
between spouses. However, when we check other empowerment-related outcomes within the family, results show
that the extent of empowerment is quite limited. Only one outcome in each set of variables (perception of gender
roles, perception of physical violence, financial independence) shows empowerment. This suggests that higher
educational attainment and improved educational status compared to the husband are not reflected in daily lives and
the perceptions of women. All in all, stronger educational outcomes for women resulting from the policy have minor
empowering effects.},
